About This Project

This project is a website built for a moving company, designed to provide users with an easy and interactive way to book moving services. The site is structured with three distinct pages, each serving a unique purpose:

Index Page: The introductory page presents the company and its services, showcasing three different moving packages with clear details and pricing options. The layout is designed for ease of navigation, helping users quickly understand the services offered.

Booking Form Page: This page allows users to enter their personal information, select a moving date, and instantly view a cost breakdown based on their choices. The form is designed to be simple and intuitive, streamlining the booking process.

Crew Introduction Page: A dynamic page that introduces the moving crew. CSS animations, such as zoom effects and shadows, add visual flair and interactivity, enhancing the user experience while providing more information about the team.
